Azure Learn-ing Journey, 
I have been self-learning Azure on Microsoft Learn docs, initially for love of learning new stuff, then ended up taking the AZ-900 Certificate exam and moving on to AZ-204 Certificate exam. 
Since then, I kept on making short notes whenever I study through the Learn modules recommended by Microsoft. So I have compiled full set of my short notes here for everyone to share just in case it comes handy for any of you out there! ;)

You can check them from here,

## [AZ-204 Study Notes](./AZ-204/README.md)

Cheers!
